# Where will blockchain go in the future?------Discussion in aspect of how to solve blockchain trilemma
## Background

In big data era, privacy data safety gradually draws public attention. We’re handing over more and more personal data to companies that store this information in **centralized** databases, which serve as a magnet for hackers looking to hijack our identities and steal our money.

Recently, lots of data breach brings giant loss to the society. Globally, the **average** cost of a data breach is **$3.62 million**.

Let’s review the biggest one------**the Facebook data breach**.

**March 18th, 2018:** 50 million Facebook profiles were harvested for Cambridge Analytica in a major data scandal. This number was revised to 87 million Facebook profiles later. Moveover, the data sold to Cambridge Analytica was then used to develop “psychographic” profiles of people and deliver pro-Trump material to them online.

**March 20th,2018:** The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) opened an investigation into whether Facebook had violated a settlement reached with the U.S. government agency in 2011 over user privacy protections.

**March 21st,2018:** Zuckerberg eventually responded to the continued fallout over the data scandal. He said: “We have a responsibility to protect your data, and if we can’t then we don’t deserve to serve you. I’ve been working to understand exactly what happened and how to make sure this doesn’t happen again.”

After the data breach, Facebook’s market value declined about **50 billion** and Facebook might face **2 trillion** fine.

## Why blockchain?

In big data era, more and more data are used to business analysis to make more money. Since public data are available but worthless, a person’s private data is precious to firms. A lot of firms pay a lot to those that have private money. Our private data are revealed unconsciously. Therefore, data safety is of vital importance for all of us.

The reason why our data are revealed is we **“trust”** those institutions and give them our private data. However, they **“betray”** us for money. If we can have a **“trustless”** system, we won’t worry about the reveal of our privacy data. Nowadays, we call this **“trustless”** system------**BLOCKCHAIN**.
